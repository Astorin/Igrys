# Disclaimer
This is my first mod and it is still a work in progress.
# Igrys
Welcome to Igrys, a barren, stone-covered planet where science meets magic. Here, the atmosphere enables the spontaneous formation of copper plates, while underground Magic Fluid fuels advanced industry.
# Glassworking
Unlock **Glass**, a new essential resource on Igrys, but useful everywhere. Use it as an alternative material in green circuit and plastic manufacturing, as well as in cheaper rocket production.
# Magic Fluid
Abundant on Igrys, **Magic Fluid** can be split into three distinct components. These can be enriched and combined to form the powerful **Magic Tesseract**.
This fluid powers new advanced science machines, which produce science twice as efficiently, but require Magic Fluid to operate.
# Much More
Discover alternative ways to produce well-known resources and rethink your production chains.

# Ongoing Development
I’m actively working to improve the experience and add new, engaging resource chains. I appreciate any feedback to help refine the mod.
This mod is designed to introduce new problem-solving challenges and expand factory optimization beyond blueprint pasting. I also aim to ensure compatibility with other planet mods.
